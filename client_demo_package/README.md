## 🚀 Demo Instructions

### Step 1: Get the Files

```bash
# Clone from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/hw3_client_demo.git
cd hw3_client_demo

# Or if you have the zip:
unzip hw3_client_demo.zip
cd hw3_client_demo
```

### Step 2: Test Connection

```bash
# Verify you can reach the server
ping linux4.cs.nycu.edu.tw
```

### Step 3: Demo as Developer

```bash
# Run developer client (connects to linux4 automatically)
python developer_client.py
```

**In the developer client:**
1. Register account: `developer1` / `password`
2. Login
3. Upload game: Enter `games/simple_chat` when prompted
4. Upload game: Enter `games/tic_tac_toe` when prompted  
5. Update game: Enter `games/simple_chat_v1.1` when prompted
6. List games (verify: simple_chat is now v1.1, tic_tac_toe is v1.0)
7. Quit

### Step 4: Demo as Player (Two Terminals)

**Terminal 1 (Player A - Host):**
```bash
python lobby_client.py

# In client:
# 1. Register: alice / password
# 2. Login
# 3. Download "simple_chat"
# 4. Create room "demo_room" for "simple_chat"
# 5. Wait for Player B to join
```

**Terminal 2 (Player B - Guest):**
```bash
python lobby_client.py

# In client:
# 1. Register: bob / password
# 2. Login
# 3. Download "simple_chat"
# 4. Join room "demo_room"
# 5. Wait for host to start
```

**Back in Terminal 1:**
- Select "Start Game"
- Game client launches automatically for both players
- Type messages to chat
- Type `/quit` to exit game
- Both return to lobby
- **Try starting another game** (shows room reuse!)

### Step 5: Demo Tic Tac Toe (Optional)

Repeat Step 4 but use "tic_tac_toe" instead:
- Download "tic_tac_toe"
- Create/join room for "tic_tac_toe"
- Play by entering positions 0-8
- Winner detected automatically

## 🌐 Server Connection

**Clients connect to `linux4.cs.nycu.edu.tw` automatically** - no configuration needed!

- Lobby Server: `linux4.cs.nycu.edu.tw:10002`
- Developer Server: `linux4.cs.nycu.edu.tw:10003`
- Game Servers: `linux4.cs.nycu.edu.tw:5000-5100`

**Optional - To use different server:**
```bash
# Player client
python lobby_client.py <host> <port>

# Developer client
python developer_client.py <host> <port>
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### ✅ What Should Work

1. **Cross-machine gameplay** - Host on one machine, guest on another
2. **Real-time communication** - Messages/moves appear immediately
3. **Room reuse** - After game ends, room resets to "waiting"
4. **Host migration** - If host leaves waiting room, guest becomes host
5. **Version updates** - Rooms auto-upgrade when developer uploads new version
6. **Clean exits** - Both players return to lobby after game ends

### 🎲 Game Descriptions

**Simple Chat v1.0:**
- 2 players
- Type messages to chat
- `/quit` to exit

**Simple Chat v1.1:**
- Same as v1.0 but with emoji support
- Try: 😊 👍 🎮 ❤️

**Tic Tac Toe v1.0:**
- 2 players (X and O)
- Enter position 0-8 to place mark
- Win by getting 3 in a row
- `/quit` to exit

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused"
- Check if server is running: `nc -vz linux4.cs.nycu.edu.tw 10002`
- Verify firewall allows outbound connections
- Try `ping linux4.cs.nycu.edu.tw`

### "Game client exited immediately"
- Game server port may be unreachable
- This is a server-side firewall issue (ports 5000-5100)
- Server admin should check `game_server_logs/` directory

### "Username already exists"
- Use different username
- Or ask server admin to run: `python clean_database.py --force`

### Game doesn't start after clicking "Start Game"
- Wait 1-2 seconds (game server needs time to start)
- Check if all players have downloaded the game
- If stuck, leave room and create new one

## 💡 Demo Tips

1. **Test connectivity first** - `ping linux4.cs.nycu.edu.tw`
2. **Use two terminals** - Easier than two machines for quick demo
3. **Upload games first** - Do developer demo before player demo
4. **Show version upgrade** - Upload v1.0, then v1.1, show auto-upgrade
5. **Show room reuse** - Play game, quit, start another game
6. **Keep it simple** - Use simple_chat for quick demo

## 📞 If Something Goes Wrong

**Check server status:**
```bash
# Test each port
nc -vz linux4.cs.nycu.edu.tw 10001  # Database
nc -vz linux4.cs.nycu.edu.tw 10002  # Lobby
nc -vz linux4.cs.nycu.edu.tw 10003  # Developer
```

**Contact server admin** if:
- All ports unreachable → Server may be down
- Lobby works but games fail → Firewall blocking game ports (5000-5100)
- Database errors → May need cleanup (`clean_database.py`)

---

## ✅ System Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Network access to linux4.cs.nycu.edu.tw
- Standard library only (no pip install needed)
